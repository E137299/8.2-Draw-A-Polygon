# 8.2-Draw-A-Polygon
In this lab, you will use user input and conditional statements to identify shapes based on the number of sides and some other properties as given by the user. Your program will then draw the polygon identified by the user.

## Identify and draw the polygon
1. Write a Python program that asks the user to think of a shape and input how many sides it has. 
2. Your program must be able to identify and draw the following shapes without the user naming the type of polygon:
   
| Number of Sides | Polygon Name |
|---|---|
|3|Triangle|
|4|Quadrilateral|
|5|Pentagon|
|6|Hexagon|
|any other number|Unknown|


3. Quadrilaterals come in many different varieties. Add code to your program so that, if the user is thinking of a quadrilateral, you ask more questions to find out which type of quadrilateral it is. Your program should give the most specific name that applies. The following table describes the quadrilaterals you should know about from most to least specific:
   
|**Property**|**Quadrilateral Name**|
|---|---|
|No two sides of the quadrilateral are parallel|Unknown quadrilateral|
|Two sides are parallel to each other and the remaining two sides are not parallel to each other|Trapezoid|
|Not a rectangle and each side is parallel to one other side|Parallelogram|
|Not a square and all four angles have the same measure|Rectangle|
|All four sides have the same length|Square|
